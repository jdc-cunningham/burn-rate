### Burn Rate
This is a basic app that pulls data from a spreadsheet, namely a finance spreadsheet that keeps track of cash/credit/other assets.
Then based on your monthly/yearly needs this app tells you how many months/years you have till you run dry.
This is a peace of mind thing for me, the numbers.

### Requirements
You need a Google account for a spreadsheet and the necessary API credentials eg. oAuth client ID and API key

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
